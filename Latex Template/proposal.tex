\subsection * {Background / Motivation}
The travel industry has undergone significant transformations in recent years, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. In this dynamic landscape, travelers seek convenient and personalized solutions that simplify the process of planning and booking their trips. As such, there is a growing demand for online platforms that offer comprehensive travel services, from exploring destination options to booking flights and accommodations.\newline Traditional methods of travel planning often involve extensive research across multiple websites, making it time-consuming and cumbersome for travelers to finalize their itineraries. Moreover, the lack of customization options and limited access to real-time information can hinder the overall travel experience.\newline In response to these challenges, there is a clear need for a centralized platform that streamlines the entire travel booking process while providing users with greater flexibility and control over their travel plans. By integrating features such as package exploration, customization options, flight booking, and secure payment gateways, we aim to address these pain points and elevate the travel booking experience for customers.\newline Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the way people approach travel, with safety and flexibility becoming paramount concerns. A robust online platform that offers transparent information, flexible booking policies, and seamless payment options will not only meet the evolving needs of travelers but also instill confidence and trust in the travel agency's services.\newline In summary, the motivation behind this project stems from the desire to revolutionize the way travelers plan and book their trips. By leveraging technology to create a user-centric travel agency website, we aim to enhance convenience, accessibility, and satisfaction for customers, ultimately establishing the travel agency as a leading player in the competitive travel industry.

    }
\end{center}

\section{System Architecture Overview}

The system architecture of \textbf{Odyssey Travels} is designed to efficiently manage travel planning and booking processes. It is structured around a web-based software application that interacts with various user types—visitors, registered users, and administrators.

\subsection{Client-Side (Frontend)}
The user interface is built using \textbf{Next.js}, a React framework that supports server-side rendering for fast and efficient page loads. The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Key features include browsing travel packages, booking accommodations, and managing user profiles. The interface components are designed to be intuitive, allowing users to navigate the site easily.

\subsection{Server-Side (Backend)}
The backend handles all data processing and business logic. It uses RESTful APIs to manage communication between the client-side and server-side components. The server processes user requests, interacts with databases to retrieve or store information, and ensures that all transactions are securely handled.

\subsection{Database}
The application utilizes a relational database to store user information, booking details, travel packages, and other related data. The database is designed for quick access and secure data storage, ensuring that user information is protected and easily retrievable.

\subsection{Integration with External Services}
Odyssey Travels integrates with external services such as payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) for secure transactions and mapping services (e.g., Google Maps) to provide location-based functionalities. Communication interfaces like SMTP or Email APIs are used to manage booking confirmations and notifications, ensuring users are kept informed throughout their travel planning process.

\subsection{Admin Dashboard}
Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage travel packages, oversee user bookings, and perform system maintenance. This component allows for efficient system management and ensures that the application remains up-to-date and functional.

\subsection{Security and Reliability}
The architecture includes robust security measures such as HTTPS for encrypted data transmission, secure authentication protocols, and regular security audits to protect user data and maintain system integrity. The system is designed to be highly reliable, with mechanisms in place to handle errors gracefully and ensure continuous operation even in the event of unexpected issues.

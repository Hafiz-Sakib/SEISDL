\section {User characteristics}
There is a single type of user interacting with the system: users of the Odyssey Travels web application. Users of our web app have specialized usage tailored to their travel planning and booking needs.
The web application allows users to explore travel packages, manage their travel itineraries, and modify their bookings at any time. This means that users need to be able to view available packages, add new bookings, and update their travel plans seamlessly.
For optimal use of our solution, users are expected to be familiar with basic web navigation and interaction. This includes the ability to use buttons, dropdown menus, side panels, and other common web interface elements effectively.
\section{Assumptions and dependencies}
One assumption about the Odyssey Travels application is that it will be used on mobile devices with adequate performance capabilities. If the device lacks sufficient hardware resources, such as processing power, RAM, or storage space, or if these resources are heavily utilized by other applications, the performance of Odyssey Travels may be compromised. In such cases, users may experience issues where the application does not function as intended, or may not work at all.

\section{Use Case Diagram}

A use case diagram is pivotal in illustrating a user's engagements with the system, depicting the correlation between the user and various use cases they engage in. This diagram serves to provide a comprehensive overview of the system and supports the detailed design process. The UML use case diagram comprises a collection of use cases that encompass all conceivable interactions outlined in the system requirements (Section 6). The use case diagram for Odyssey Travels is delineated in Figure-7.1.

\end{center}

Although we adhere to the object-oriented approach (OOP) in developing our system, Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) may occasionally be indispensable for enhanced comprehension. Therefore, we have included the DFDs of the Odyssey Travels project in Appendix-I to provide clarity where necessary.

\chapter{System Evolution}
We have formulated foundational assumptions pivotal for launching the Odyssey Travel Agency project. This section delineates these assumptions, addressing potential impacts from advancements in hardware/software, evolving user demands, and other pertinent factors.

Our software development lifecycle extends beyond initial deployment, encompassing ongoing refinement and adaptation. Post-deployment, adjustments may be necessary to address operational issues, accommodate platform updates, and enhance performance and other non-functional attributes. Given that our product is managed internally within our organization, ongoing support and evolution are integral to its lifecycle without necessitating additional contractual agreements.

The evolution process involves essential activities such as change analysis, release planning, system implementation, and customer delivery. We have identified potential post-deployment challenges and their underlying assumptions, summarized in Table-I, to proactively address and mitigate any arising issues.

\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{13cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{SN.} & \textbf{Reasons that can drive us to make urgent changes} \\
\hline
1. & User encounters issues with booking confirmations not being received on time. Immediate action is required to fix the notification system to maintain customer trust. \\
\hline
2. & The integration with third-party services (e.g., flight or hotel booking APIs) changes their formats or access methods, causing disruptions in our service. We need to quickly adapt to these changes to keep our booking system functional. \\
\hline
3. & The website's performance degrades significantly under high traffic conditions, which can occur during peak travel seasons. We must improve the server scalability and optimize the codebase to handle increased loads effectively. \\
\hline
4. & New security vulnerabilities are discovered that could potentially expose user data. Immediate security patches and updates are necessary to protect user information and comply with data protection regulations. \\
\hline
5. & A major update is released for the mobile operating system that our mobile app relies on, leading to compatibility issues. We need to update the app promptly to ensure a seamless experience for our users. \\

Maintenance Predictions for our travel website involve strategic planning to address potential challenges that could impact our system's functionality and user experience. One critical aspect is \textbf{source code translation}, where older programming languages are updated to newer versions or entirely different languages using automated tools, ensuring compatibility and performance enhancements. \textbf{Program structure improvement} is another vital strategy, focusing on analyzing and refining the control structures within our software to enhance readability and maintainability, often requiring a balance of automated tools and manual interventions. \textbf{Program modularization} plays a key role by organizing related components to streamline functionality and reduce redundancy, fostering easier updates and scalability. These techniques anticipate future needs, such as accommodating new travel packages and user preferences through interface updates. Additionally, they prepare us for regulatory changes or updates in third-party services, ensuring seamless integration and compliance. As we roll out new versions, addressing potential bugs and user environment variability becomes paramount, necessitating thorough \textbf{code refactoring} processes to optimize performance and stability. Finally, integrating with emerging social media platforms necessitates backend modifications, highlighting the importance of \textbf{integration and migration} strategies in our maintenance predictions. Overall, these proactive measures ensure our travel website remains robust, adaptable, and responsive to evolving customer demands and technological advancements.
